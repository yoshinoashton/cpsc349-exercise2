      <p>Hi! It's a pleasure to introduce myself to you. My name is Ashton Yoshino and I am currently a 3rd year @ California State University Fullerton working towards a B.S in Computer Science. I find outer-space really interesting and hope that my future career plays a part in space exploration. This is my first time building a website and it is a lot of fun so far. Look down below to read more about some of my hobbies!</p>
